The goal was to predict the the prices of the airbnb listings as close as possible using any knows machine learning technique that we have learned throughout the semester. One restriction was that we were not allowed to use any built in libraries that can assist with the predictions and had to write the model from scratch.

## Technologies and APIs
* Python 3
* Jupiter Notebook
* Math and Machine Learning Python Libraries like: numpy, pandas, scipy, etc.

## Status
Project is: _finished_
